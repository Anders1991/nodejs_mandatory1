    <h2>What is it?</h2>
    <p>This file is where we define all of our server routing, which port the server should listen to and what it should do with certain calls.</p>
    <h2>Setting up</h2>
    <p>First we need to import the library express as follows:</p>
    <code>const { json } = require("express");<br>
        const express = require("express");</code>
    <p>We then make an instantiated instance of express</p>
    <code>app.use(express.json());</code>
    <p>Now we can start using express to handle http requests for our server. As such lets take a look at the following code:</p>
    <code>app.get("/", (req, res) => {<br>
    
        res.sendFile('index.html',{root:'public'});<br>
    
    });</code>
    <p>Here we ask express to handle a GET request for our server, by <b>res</b>ponding with sending the file index.html to the user.</p>
    <p>We could also <b>req</b>uire some data from the user, and send something appropriate back. </p>
    <p>Last but not least we should allow the server to run on a port:</p>
    <code>app.listen(8080);</code>
    <p>Here we ask express to listen to the port 8080 (localhost) for our app.</p>
