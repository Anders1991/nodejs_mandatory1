            <h2>What is it?</h2>
            <p><b>SSR</b> is short for "Serverside Rendering" as opposed to 
                <b>CSR</b> which is short for "Clientside Rendering". 
                Serverside Rendering causes the server to load the page before it sends it to the user 
                (as opposed to CSR where the page is loaded in the browser on the clients machine).</p>
        </div>
        <div class="contentFrame">
            <p>Below is a list of pros and cons of SSR</p>
            <h2>Pros</h2>
            <p><b>Faster initial access</b></p>
            <p>The pages are rendered immediately, even on slow internet connections because the browser doesn't have to load the javascript before it sends the page.</p>
            <p><b>Better SEO</b></p>
            <p>Search engines don't have to run your javascript before they index your site.</p>
            <h2>Cons</h2>
            <p><b>Pricier servers</b></p>
            <p>SSR requires better and bigger servers than CSR, because it is more dependant on internet speed.</p>
            <p><b>High user traffic = slower for everyone</b></p>
