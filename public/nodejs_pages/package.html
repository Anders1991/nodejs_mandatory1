    <h1>nodejs Package.json</h1>
    <h2>What is it?</h2>
    <p>The package.json file is where we define our dependencies such as the external library Express. We also define the version of nodejs we want.</p>
    <p>We also define scripts we can run from the terminal. When hosting on Heroku it is sometimes necessary to include the following script to run the server:</p>
    <code>"scripts": {
        "start": "node app.js"
    }</code>
    <p>The only thing it does is run the file app.js (which is very important!).</p>
